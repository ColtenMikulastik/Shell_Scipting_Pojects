so we need to download the html file from the internet, and look through it for the data that we want.
    -check every day I think would be good
    -start from the top of the page, looking for keywords.
        -when found then add those links to a file


Then we need to make a queue that will go through each link and use a torrent client to download information.
    -check that there are changes between the new and the old, and only download if they are old
    -read from the torrent file, and download necissary content.
